## Workshop 1 30/01/23
### Introduction to Statistics
Today we set up the github repo, linked the scripts with the repo using the token and completed chapter 12 coursebook on BlackBoard. We were working with a new dataset: darwin, which looks at pairs of plants and their height when outcrossed or inbred. We cleaned the data, visualised it using a geom_point and geom_boxplot and then began making estimates on the means, sd, se and confidence intervals of the data.
