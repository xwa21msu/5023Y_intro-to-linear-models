# 5023Y_intro-to-linear-models

## Workshop 1 30/01/23
### Introduction to Statistics
Today we set up the github repo, linked the scripts with the repo using the token and completed chapter 12 coursebook on BlackBoard. We were working with a new dataset: darwin, which looks at pairs of plants and their height when outcrossed or inbred. We cleaned the data, visualised it using a geom_point and geom_boxplot and then began making estimates on the means, sd, se and confidence intervals of the data.

## Workshop 2 10/02/23
### Introduction to Linear Models
Today we created a new script for workshop two and completed chapter 13 of the coursebook on Blackboard. We took the Darwin data, applied a linear model using base R and tidyverse functions, including `broom` that presents the results more clearly. We answered the hypothesis that selfed plants are smaller as a result of inbreeding with confidence intervals. We finally looked at the importance of making assumptions about the dataset, such as normal distribution, equal variance etc and explored ways to test this. We did not account for paired observations, but will do this next time.
